Tomxis2
=======

A rapid service development framework. It allows to jump directly into the service development instead of configuring a Tomcat or an Axis2 environment. Tomxis2 brings both as Maven dependencies.

It will have a heroku connection so that it can be easily deployed on an amazon cloud server.

The framework is currently in an unstable development state.
